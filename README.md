# ACC Hotlap Run Compare

This tool is used to record and compare the own runs from the Hotlap gamemode in the game Assetto Corsa Competizione. It automatically gathers data while driving and saves them so one can compare the different runs at a later point.

## Features

- Automatically record runs : Get the sector time of each sector, get the lap times, get the fastest lap time
- Display recorded runs
  - See total time, amount of laps, fastest lap time
  - Sort by total time, fastest lap time or by the day it was recorded
  

## Planned for the future

- Delete single runs
- Live position during a run: Be able to see your current run compared to the other runs (same track, same car, same session length)
- Add information to finished runs: Add a description to the run (e.g. setup name, weather conditions, ... )
- Direct comparison between sector times of two (or more) distinct runs
